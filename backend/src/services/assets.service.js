/**
 * Asset management: inventory and custody.
 *
 * FILES ARE ATTACHMENTS, NOT COLUMNS. Purchase receipts go through the
 * polymorphic attachments table (entity_type 'asset') rather than a receipt_path
 * column. This is also the only version that gets tenant isolation, path-traversal
 * defence, soft delete and an audit entry per upload.
 *
 * Asset status is derived from its active custody assignment: assigned or
 * available. Retired is a terminal state until reinstated.
 *
 * Every mutation below recomputes it from the rows rather than trusting a
 * supplied value. The alternative — a `status` column a form posts — is the
 * reason spreadsheets disagree with their own contents: the column and the rows
 * beside it drift, and then the register is a work of fiction. Here the two
 * cannot disagree, because only one of them is writable.
 *
 * The database backs this up independently, so a bug in the service cannot leave
 * an asset held by two employees: `assets.active_assignment_guard` and
 * `asset_assignments.open_assignment_guard` are generated columns that are
 * UNIQUE only while the row is open. Both were verified to reject a second open
 * row, which the original (asset_uuid, returned_at) key did NOT.
 *
 * Every read is scoped by organization_id. No function here accepts an org id
 * from the request body — it always comes from the auth middleware, or a guessed
 * uuid 404s instead of leaking another tenant's inventory.
