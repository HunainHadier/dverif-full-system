/**
 * Expense claims: an employee spends company money, and gets it back.
 *
 * One table. A claim is free text — an expense name, an amount, a date and an
 * optional receipt. There is no category policy table: the org cannot cap or
 * pre-approve what may be claimed, so review is the only gate.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT THIS MODULE EXISTS TO PROTECT: a claim is paid exactly once.
 *
 * Payroll reimburses approved claims that go through payroll, and a claim can also
 * be settled directly as a bank transfer. Two administrators, two clicks, one
 * expense paid twice is otherwise the default outcome, because the window between
 * "approved" and "paid" is long enough for it to happen. Three things prevent it:
 *
 *   - approval does not mark anything paid. There is a distinct, terminal `paid`
 *     state and only two ways into it.
 *   - every write into `paid` is guarded by the state it moves FROM: approval
 *     updates `WHERE status='pending'`, a manual settlement `WHERE status='approved'`,
 *     and a payroll run `WHERE status='approved'`. Two concurrent runs therefore
 *     cannot both win - the loser matches zero rows.
 *   - paid_via_salary_record_uuid names the record that consumed each claim, so a
 *     claim can be traced to the payslip that carried it and cannot be re-run.
 *
 * THERE IS NO `is_paid` COLUMN, and that is worth being explicit about. `status`
 * alone carries it: 'paid' IS the flag. An earlier draft of this module described
 * the guards in terms of `is_paid=0`, which reads like an extra safety net but was
 * never real - and a comment describing a column that does not exist is worse than
 * no comment, because it sends the next reader hunting for a second source of truth
 * that was never there.
 *
 * `paid` IS TERMINAL. Re-marking a paid claim would be the cheapest possible way
 * to pay someone twice, and there is no operational reason to want it.

 *   payment_mode         a direct claim is settled by bank transfer and must never
 *                        appear on a payslip, or it gets paid twice
 *   reimbursement period is assigned when approved, after checking whether its
 *                        expense period already has payroll. Any older unpaid
 *                        claim carries forward rather than being stranded by a
 *                        previously processed payroll.
 *
 * Takes a connection so payroll can read and write in one transaction. Reading on
 * the pool and writing on a transaction is how a claim ends up marked paid against a
 * payroll that then rolls back.
