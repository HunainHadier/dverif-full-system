/**
 * Employee self-service: MY expense claims.
 *
 * Mounted at the top level (/my-expenses), NOT under /org/*, because this is the
 * employee portal rather than a staff module — same reasoning as /my-assets.
 *
 * Plan-gated on expense_management, matching the staff routes. A module an org has
 * not bought cannot have claims filed against it.
 *
 * The role check present on /my-letters is deliberately ABSENT here, and this is a
 * real difference rather than an oversight: letters are a document the company
 * issues, whereas a claim is a submission the employee makes. A sub-admin who is
 * also on the roster has expenses to reclaim exactly like anyone else, and gating
 * them out of their own reimbursement would be a bug.
 *
 * As in the assets controller, the employee is derived from the JWT and no handler
 * accepts an employee_uuid, so there is no parameter a caller could change to file
 * or read someone else's claim.

 * claim about authority that the sender made up, and honouring it is how a
 * permission check stops being one. The permission comes from the user's own
 * `feature_access`, resolved here, so the checkbox in the modal is a visibility
 * rule and never the gate.
 *
 * Attaching the answer to the request rather than throwing keeps the endpoint
 * usable: an employee without the permission can still FILE a claim - it simply
 * lands as pending, and the service turns down the auto-approval.
