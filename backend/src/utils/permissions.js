/**
 * Canonical ordered list of feature-access permissions.
 *
 * ORDER MATTERS only in that the pre-existing keys are pinned by tests, so new keys
 * are APPENDED rather than inserted, or those tests fail on a reorder that changed
 * nothing.
 *
 * The HR-module keys (hr_letters, manage_assets, manage_separation,
 * approve_expenses) and the separate create_expenses capability exist because
 * those modules were staff-open to EVERY sub-admin
 * regardless of feature_access: the role gate said "staff" and nothing said otherwise,
 * so a sub-admin holding none of these saw every one of them. That is delegation with
 * no dial on it.
 *
 * They deliberately default to FALSE, like manage_employees and the request
 * permissions, and NOT to TRUE like attendance/leave/payroll. The TRUE_BY_DEFAULT
 * three are an employee's own self-service (clocking in, asking for leave), where
 * denying by default would lock people out of the product for no reason. These grant
 * an org_admin the ability to attest to someone's employment to a third party, spend
 * company money, or terminate an employment — none of which should be handed to
 * a sub-admin who was not explicitly given it. Least privilege, and it is the
 * difference between "sub-admins are trusted" and "sub-admins are configured".
 *
 * ONE KEY FOR RECRUITMENT, not a split between managing and conducting. The split
 * was considered and rejected, and the reasoning is recorded because the question
 * will be asked again: a `conduct_interviews` key is only meaningful if the product
 * has a role that interviews without administering hiring. It does not — the roles
 * are org_admin and sub_admin, and recruiting is one workflow. Splitting would make
 * using the module require ticking two boxes, and would add a second key to keep in
 * step across the backend, ROUTE_ACCESS and the grant form. If a "hiring manager,
 * not a recruiter" persona appears, the pattern for splitting is already here.
